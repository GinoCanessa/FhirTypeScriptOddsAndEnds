   * ACCESSCONSCHEME: An access control policy specific to the type of access control scheme, which is used to enforce one or more authorization policies.

   *                         
   *                            Usage Note: Access control schemes are the type of access control policy, which is comprised of access control policy rules concerning the provision of the access control service.
   * 
   *                         There are two categories of access control policies, rule-based and identity-based, which are identified in CCITT Rec. X.800 aka ISO 7498-2. Rule-based access control policies are intended to apply to all access requests by any initiator on any target in a security domain. Identity-based access control policies are based on rules specific to an individual initiator, a group of initiators, entities acting on behalf of initiators, or originators acting in a specific role. Context can modify rule-based or identity-based access control policies. Context rules may define the entire policy in effect. Real systems will usually employ a combination of these policy types; if a rule-based policy is used, then an identity-based policy is usually in effect also.
   * 
   *                         An access control scheme may be based on access control lists, capabilities, labels, and context or a combination of these.  An access control scheme is a component of an access control mechanism or "service") along with the supporting mechanisms required by that scheme to provide access control decision information (ADI) supplied by the scheme to the access decision facility (ADF also known as a PDP). (Based on ISO/IEC 10181-3:1996)
