/**
 *  A set of codes specifying the modality by which the Entity playing the Role is participating in the Act.  Examples:
 * Physically present, over the telephone, written communication.  Rationale:
 * Particularly for author (originator) participants this is used to specify whether the information represented by the act was initially provided verbally, (hand-)written, or electronically.  Open Issue:
 * There needs to be a reexamination of the hierarchies as there seems to be some muddling between ELECTRONIC and other concepts that involve electronic communication that are in other hierarchies.
